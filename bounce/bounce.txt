Using the program bounce.c, try to accomplish the following steps.
You can change anything you want, such as add or change functions, add or
change variables. It is recommended to start changing the function "play" or
the initialization of global variables.

- Step 1: "bounce horizontally"
    Modify the original file bounce.c.
    Make the ball bounce horizontally in the borders of the window.
    From right to left, then left to right, and repeat.

- Step 2: "bounce vertically"
    Modify the original file bounce.c.
    Make the ball bounce vertically in the borders of the window.
    From top to bottom, then bottom to top, and repeat.

- Step 3: "bounce diagonally"
    Modify the original file bounce.c.
    Combine steps 2 and 3, and make the ball move diagonally and
    bounce in all the borders of the window.

- Step 4: "bounce and deflate"
    From step 3 as a starting point, modify the program in a way that the
    borders of the windows move to the center one step for each bounce.
    Touch the left, move left one step to the center. Touch the right, move
    the right one step to the center. The same with top and bottom borders.
    There is a moment where the window "disappears". There you exit the program.
    Try this example with a window with size 50x30 more or less, and expand your
    terminal to make space for the window to fit in.

- Step 5
    From step 3 as a starting point, add a "status" in the bottom right corner
    showing the count of bounces.

- Step 6
    Use of structs. Starting from "bounce-b.c" redo to get the result from step 5.
    As you see in the file, many global variables have being moved into structs.

- Ideas:
    Change the ball for a snake (learn array).
    Create one obstacle in the window, and bounce if it is touched.
